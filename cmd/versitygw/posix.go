		Name:  "posix",
		Usage: "posix filesystem storage backend",
		Description: `Any posix filesystem that supports extended attributes. The top level
directory for the gateway must be provided. All sub directories of the
top level directory are treated as buckets, and all files/directories
below the "bucket directory" are treated as the objects. The object
name is split on "/" separator to translate to posix storage.
For example:
top level: /mnt/fs/gwroot
bucket: mybucket
object: a/b/c/myobject
will be translated into the file /mnt/fs/gwroot/mybucket/a/b/c/myobject`,
		Action: runPosix,
